#washer-pi

These are the files for the Pi Zero that runs at the Washing Machine

The washermon_mqtt.py script is installed as a systemd service.  It uses existing python scripts to get the photoresistor value from the A/D, and based on the status of the value, sends 'Done' MQTT message as 1 or 0

This part was done first.  Here are the steps as best as I can recall from bash history commands and other things rattling around in my head.

Flashed SD card with Raspbian (previous name of Raspberry Pi OS) 'Stretch'.  Current version of Raspberry Pi OS should work too.
Connected Pi to Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse.  
Started up to GUI, went through general setup
At GUI/Desktop, used Raspberry Pi Configuration:
   Set hostname (washermon)
   Boot to desktop
   Autologin as user 'pi'
   Enable Interfaces: SSH, VNC, SPI, I2C, Remote GPIO

Command line magic
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-pip
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_BME280.git
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-rpi.gpio
sudo pip install Adafruit-GPIO


Challenge in getting script to run automatically at powerup of Pi (or power reset)
.bashrc tried first but was not always reliable
/etc/rc.local 
Ended up using systemd as the driver for the program.  Shout out to Dexter Industries for this great how-to
